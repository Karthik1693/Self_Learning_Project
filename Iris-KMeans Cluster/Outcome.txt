Project :
----------

IRIS Dataset is like the Hello World of Machine learning to start.

Objective : Classify a flower into one of these 3 flower.

Alogirthm used : K Means Clustering

Things learnt in this project :
-------------------------------

Data points - Rows/Vector - nDimensional array

Variables - Fields/Column/Feature  

Class label - Independent label/output lable - Using the Data points and variable to predict the class latbel.

1-D Array is vector

Understanding the each Feature (Domain language) is important.

K Means Clustering :
-> Comes under unsupervised learning.
-> Identify the number of cluster we want which is K Value or Centroid.(Elbow method - Find wess value which shows minimum change)
-> Randomnly select K data points.
-> Measure the distance between data points and the K values,group them into clusters based on the distance(use Eucledian distance),then find the mean.
-> Change the K value to mean and cluster again until group doesnt change after changing K value with mean,

Tableau to visualize data.


Coding :
--------

1.Exploratory Data analysis :
Check the shape,counts and whether its imbalanced or balanced.
Plot graph,observe and find patterns.

Used Tableau to Visualize the data. Results : https://public.tableau.com/profile/karthikeyan4498#!/vizhome/IRIS_EDA/Dashboard1
