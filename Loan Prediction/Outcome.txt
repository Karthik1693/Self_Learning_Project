Project :
----------

Objective : Predict the loan can be given to the customers.

Alogirthm used : Logistic Regression

Things learnt in this project :
-------------------------------

--> Hypothesis generation - Brainstrom and identify what can impact the target variable prediction before looking into the data.

In our case, Below could impact the loan prediction :

1. His/Her Credit score.
2. Existing EMI and Loans.
3. Salary
4. Job Security

--> Univariate Analysis - Analyse each variable in dataset.
--> Catagorical Feature - will be in catagory - Gender,Account type
--> Ordinal Feature - will have some orders in catagory - Property_area,Education
--> Numerical Feature - will be in number - Salary,Age
--> Bivariate Analysis -- Analyse each variable respect to target variable
--> use heatmap and plot using correlation
--> fill na with mean,mode,median
--> Evaluation metrices

Logistic Regression
1. update target variable to numeric
2. drop target variable and save in new df. save target data in new variable
3. Create dummies to replace all catagorical to number

split test and train
predict the model for test value
and compare the result with actual value
